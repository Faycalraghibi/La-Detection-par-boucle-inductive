# La-Detection-par-boucle-inductive
# Parking System Simulation
This is a parking system simulation implemented using Python and Pygame. The system allows cars to navigate a track and park in designated parking slots. The simulation provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
# Installation
Clone the repository:

```
clone https://github.com/Faycalraghibi/La-Detection-par-boucle-inductive.git
```
Install the required dependencies. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```
# Usage
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the following command to start the simulation:
```
python parking_system.py
```
The simulation will open in a new window. Use the following controls to interact with the system:
```
A key: Rotate the car left.
D key: Rotate the car right.
W key: Move the car forward.
S key: Move the car backward.
SPACE key: Stop the car.
ENTER key: Park the car.
```
The parking slots are displayed on the screen. Green rectangles represent available slots, while red rectangles represent occupied slots.

The control panel on the right side of the screen displays commands for parking slots. Green rectangles indicate available slots, and red rectangles indicate occupied slots.
